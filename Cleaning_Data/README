This folder contains a few scripts for performing data cleanup and merging. 

Specifically, the V-COCO dataset is a subset of the MS-COCO dataset from 2014. It is necessary to download the entire dataset
of MS-COCO, and pick out only those images with V-COCO annotations. Additionally, for this project, it was necessary to merge
the datasets corresponding to different annotation types: those for the standard object-relation challenges (as utilized
in Mask R-CNN, for example) and keypoint annotations for 2D human psoe estimation. 

The scripts here handle all of these tasks, including picking out the "supercategory" data related to building 
the skeletons for the keypoint task. A script in the style of bearpaw's ms-coco data pre-processing script (https://github.com/bearpaw/pytorch-pose/blob/master/miscs/gen_coco.m)
is provided, which pulls in annotation information pertaining to sit/stand actions. 

All together, these scripts allow the user to translate their data from the MS-COCO and V-COCO standards, to the dataloader input 
of the stacked hourglass style architectures.
