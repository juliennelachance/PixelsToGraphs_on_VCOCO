This folder contains the modified code necessary for testing modifications to the Stacked Hourglass architecture.

In particular, we wanted to ensure that the ablation tests weren't indicative of having "more layers" between 
the bottlenecks in the network; i.e., that we couldn't improve performance by dumping FC layers in the 
middle of the network. Happily, the stacked hourglass net was found to outperform our tests.
